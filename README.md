# MATLAB-Assignments-and-Projects
In this project, I worked with arrays in MATLAB to perform various manipulations and analysis. I utilized MATLAB's built-in functions to perform tasks such as sorting, filtering, indexing, and calculating statistical measures on arrays of data. I also implemented custom algorithms using loops and conditional statements to further analyze and manipulate the arrays. The project allowed me to gain proficiency in array operations and data analysis techniques using MATLAB.
This project focused on understanding and utilizing looping structures in MATLAB. I implemented different types of loops, such as for loops and while loops, to iterate over arrays and perform repetitive tasks. I explored control flow statements, such as if-else statements and switch-case statements, to add conditional logic within the loops. Through this project, I gained a strong understanding of loop control and flow in MATLAB, enabling me to efficiently process and manipulate data.
I used MATLAB's Simulink tool to model and simulate dynamic systems. I designed block diagrams representing system components and their interactions, using Simulink's extensive library of predefined blocks. I configured and connected these blocks to create a complete system model. I then simulated the model to observe the system's behavior and analyze its response. This project enhanced my skills in system modeling, simulation, and analysis using Simulink.
In this project, I utilized LabVIEW, a graphical programming environment, to develop an interface for data acquisition and control systems. I connected hardware devices, such as sensors and actuators, to a computer and used LabVIEW to interface with them. I designed user-friendly front panels with buttons, knobs, and graphs to control the hardware and display real-time data. This project provided me with hands-on experience in creating intuitive interfaces for data acquisition and control applications using LabVIEW.
This project involved creating a MATLAB program to solve quadratic equations. I implemented a function that accepted the coefficients of a quadratic equation and used the quadratic formula to calculate the roots. The program considered different cases, such as real and complex roots, and provided appropriate outputs. I also incorporated error handling to handle exceptional cases. Through this project, I strengthened my problem-solving skills and learned to implement mathematical algorithms in MATLAB and many more.

These projects demonstrate my proficiency in various MATLAB concepts and tools, including array manipulation, loops, Simulink modeling, LabVIEW interface development, and mathematical algorithm implementation. They highlight my ability to utilize MATLAB for data analysis, simulation, control systems, and mathematical computations.
